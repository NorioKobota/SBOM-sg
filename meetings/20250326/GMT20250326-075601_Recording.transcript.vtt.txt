00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.460
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Hello! Everyone.

2
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.990
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Hey, Shane, where are you today

3
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:18.830
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That's a good question. I just arrived back in Japan a couple of hours ago from Korea. So I'm fine.

4
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.159
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And how are you doing today?

5
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.870
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Oh, well, greetings from Zurich. Yeah. Like, last week I was

6
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.539
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): bit down because of the common cold. But now back to normal, more or less

7
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.030
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Right.

8
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.423
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I can imagine that.

9
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.110
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): it's not so easy to to deal with. A cold. Springtime is terrible that way.

10
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.620
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Yep, and it's been going around like more or less everybody around here, you know

11
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.630
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): I've got it. And now it was my turn

12
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.010
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I understand today we're going to have

13
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:16.439
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): probably Market Tom, talk about the new Telco Guide update, and so on and so forth.

14
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.269
Vivek Kumar Sahu (Individual Contribution): Hello! Everyone!

15
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.390
Vivek Kumar Sahu (Individual Contribution): Hi!

16
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.010
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Right there.

17
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:48.489
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Oh, before we get started. I think we're just waiting for Kubota Sam to dial in.

18
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:58.580
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I just wanted to let everyone know that the Lf. Member Summit last week was busy and a wonderful

19
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:09.130
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): chance for networking. We had a lot of the open chain Japan Member companies attending, and

20
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.030
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I think it was a pretty good situation to meet people that we mightn't normally

21
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:24.919
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in particular. For example, I met Richard from ant finance there, and

22
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.699
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the things like our work on S bomb aren't really catching the attention of

23
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.629
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): companies working in areas like finance, where

24
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:45.210
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): regulation is so important. And there's so much that they have to do to try to make sure that everything is managed very carefully

25
00:05:47.086 --> 00:05:53.879
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): this year. I think we'll have Open Source Summit Europe. In Amsterdam.

26
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.920
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): There will be an open source summit in Korea.

27
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.289
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and there'll be an open source summit in Japan

28
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.510
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): as well as an open source summit in North America which will be in Denver, Colorado.

29
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.769
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So if anyone has the chance to go to one of those events, I highly recommend it.

30
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:24.309
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Anyway, I see Kubota-san is here, Kubota-san, I'll hand over to you for the opening, and all of that

31
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.230
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Hello, Shane. Thank you very much. And I'm very sorry to be late.

32
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:41.140
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): because today I came to my office, and my office is very crowded, so it's difficult to find out. It's a meeting room.

33
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.770
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'm very sorry.

34
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:51.150
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, anyway, I will. Can you hear my voice? And my screen

35
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.530
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We can hear your voice perfectly, and yes, the screen is sharing

36
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:05.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, thank you very much. And today, let's start the open chairs from study group number 7.

37
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.620
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you for joining.

38
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:25.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And firstly, I'm not sure sham have all has already mentioned. This is a activities under the foundation. So I will show you the extra sports. You know this 1st at at first, st

39
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.000
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and please follow this and trust policy. Notice

40
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:36.659
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and saying, Please follow this code of conduct provided by the Linux Foundation also.

41
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay?

42
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.990
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is a recap of the previous meeting.

43
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.294
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And

44
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:58.660
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): last time we share I shared the current challenges among Japan communities and discussed about some challenges we have

45
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and thank you very much for the discussion. Last time.

46
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:14.799
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And today, we will continue this challenge discussions. And I'd like to ask some thoughts on this from both all over you.

47
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.350
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is a today's topic.

48
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:36.899
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, as some of you may know, last week the open chain tech working group released the updated version of the S Bomb guide. And today, market, Jensen kindly provide an overview of these modifications made to the guide.

49
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:43.109
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I'm not sure, Maxha, are you here?

50
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:53.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, I find you so, Max. And could you introduce a brief introduction about the Telco guide

51
00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:08.929
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Hello, yes, sir, so I already made a presentation of the guide in this group some time ago.

52
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:29.049
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and asked me to say a few words about as a new version, one dot one as that we published recently. So it's a minor update. But

53
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.100
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): I'm happy to

54
00:09:33.914 --> 00:09:39.005
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Say a few words about it. So let me share my screen.

55
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.530
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Okay, so do you see my screen

56
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.990
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, perfect.

57
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.490
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Okay?

58
00:10:04.355 --> 00:10:08.169
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So as a reminder, we

59
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:19.839
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): had the 1st release. One dot 0 of the openshine Telco guide approved in May last year.

60
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:38.899
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and we have put it into a practice at Nokia. So we use this guide as a foundation for our schema. So we

61
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:45.460
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): if we we'll provide to our customers.

62
00:10:46.216 --> 00:10:54.290
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): As forms that are compatible with this, with the recommendation of of the guide

63
00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.400
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and some of our internal tools

64
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:15.509
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): already produce S bombs that are compatible with the guide, and well, not not not all. Do so for the moment, but we we plan to to do so.

65
00:11:16.523 --> 00:11:29.499
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And as it was already mentioned, we provide a validator to to check the conformance of an S. Per

66
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:44.521
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to to the guide. That was one of the ideas of our work. It was to have a specification precise enough so that we can.

67
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:50.020
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We can have an easy way to to validate it.

68
00:11:53.263 --> 00:12:08.039
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So something also quite new. We have worked with. The company scan oss

69
00:12:08.881 --> 00:12:13.758
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): they have told us that they would like to

70
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:41.385
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to provide an output that is compliant with the guide. So after some meetings with them, they released their latest version a few days ago. Version one dot 20 dot 5, and the output of scan oss is now compliant with the guide, which is

71
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:46.092
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): good, which is a good news.

72
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:58.640
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so we at Nokia we use quite a lot yocto.

73
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.265
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

74
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:26.699
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we have checked the yocto output against the open chain, Telco guide, and we found 2 things that were systematically not compliant with the guide.

75
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:37.379
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): One of the antia minimum requirements is to provide a hash

76
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:49.689
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): for packages. So that's a way that anti recommends in order to check that the package has not been modified.

77
00:13:49.950 --> 00:14:04.899
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and so in version one dot 0 of the guide, we required the presence of the Spdx attribute package checksum.

78
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:10.190
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And so by checking the Yocto output.

79
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.759
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we realized that Yocto did provide a hash.

80
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:21.840
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): but it did not provide it as a packet checksum, but as a package verification code.

81
00:14:22.789 --> 00:14:41.320
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So if you check the the Spdx document, the package checksum is a global checksum calculated on the package and, on the other hand, the package verification code

82
00:14:41.340 --> 00:15:09.179
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): is calculated with an algorithm where you calculate checksum of every file, and then you combine all these checksum and calculate the checksum on the set of checksum of every file. So that's a different way to do it. But it's also

83
00:15:09.964 --> 00:15:28.580
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a valid way to to provide this check. Some of the package, and indeed, caesar provided recently the 3rd edition of their framing software component transparency document.

84
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:36.280
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): where you find in section 2.5 a table that maps

85
00:15:37.356 --> 00:15:48.373
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): is some required fields to where Spdx, 2 Spx free and cyclone Dx

86
00:15:49.200 --> 00:16:14.061
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): implementation, and for the Ntia minimum element hash. They allow both the package checksum and the package verification code. So we will allow both, we allow, both in in the release, one dot, one of the of the open chain Telco guide.

87
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.719
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and as a

88
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:32.689
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): minor but related thing in version 1.0, we required the presence of the file. Analyzed element.

89
00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:49.004
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Remember you that for a given package you files analyzed is a Boolean. It might be false. In that case you provide

90
00:16:49.710 --> 00:17:11.559
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): information on the package, but not on the individual files that compose the package. And if it's true, you provide information on the individual files that compose the package. So in Spdx, this.

91
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:20.879
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the files analyzed can be omitted, and that is equivalent to providing it with the value. True.

92
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:31.559
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So Yocto does analysis at the package level, and it used default value of.

93
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:38.479
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So we know in version one dot one no longer required

94
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.130
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): require this. The presence of files analyzed.

95
00:17:43.303 --> 00:17:53.060
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So with these modifications, the Yocto output is mostly compatible. I

96
00:17:53.320 --> 00:18:10.867
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): don't say that it is fully compatible in some cases. We found that the code provided by produced by Yocto was invalid

97
00:18:12.348 --> 00:18:30.300
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in some cases, for instance, they deliver identifiers that are not syntactically valid, for instance, because in the identifier. They have a plus sign

98
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:42.799
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): which is not which is not allowed by Spdx. But that's rather minor. So we we have filed issues for for that

99
00:18:46.400 --> 00:19:06.160
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So in the version 1.1 of the guide, we have added one chapter at the end that lists precisely the differences between one dot 0 and 1.1.

100
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:11.900
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So this is the 1st part of the differences.

101
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:35.266
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and the main difference is that is what I just explained. So now for the package hash. We allow both the package check some and the package verification code, and we we no longer make files analyze mandatory. It's allowed to use the default value of true

102
00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:42.769
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): also we downgraded the package rush to

103
00:19:42.930 --> 00:20:06.829
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): recommended instead of mandatory. It's still a very good thing to include it, but in some cases, like when Gsbom contains proprietary code, it might be difficult to to provide it.

104
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:21.110
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And the last thing on this slide. We had mandatory external ref

105
00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:35.640
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we use the external ref to put the package, URL, the perl of packages, and there was a small inconsistency

106
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:53.660
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in the sense that we recommended usage of the pearl, but he made the external ref mandatory which makes no sense. If you don't provide the pearl, you you don't

107
00:20:54.866 --> 00:21:00.851
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): have to to put a mandatory external rep. So that was kind of a technical.

108
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:06.789
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a mistake. So now, it's

109
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:16.529
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): consistent. We recommend using the Perl to identify the package, and so the external ref is recommended also.

110
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:26.780
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Then, there was some discussions

111
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:45.250
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): on the mailing list, and in the meetings about the Caesar has bond types. So there is in Spdx to know fields. That is

112
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:59.649
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): There is no field for specifically for that purpose. So we we use

113
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.766
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): as a Creator command to to put it

114
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:21.999
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so. One of the remarks was that in Creator Com you have to put type in the Creator commands. But of course you can

115
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:38.150
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): put anything else you want in this Creator, comment Field, as before. So this has been a bit clarified. So that is 1 point.

116
00:22:39.045 --> 00:22:48.010
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Another thing is that in version one dot 0. The only

117
00:22:49.990 --> 00:23:16.630
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): what we said was that you had to put one of the words design source, build, analyze, deployed runtime in the field. But one remark was that it was not. It might not have been clear if you just put the keyword in the Creator command.

118
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:21.789
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So now we still allow

119
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:42.900
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): any any syntax for this Sbom type in the Creator command, but we recommend to put it in with the words S bomb type before before the keyword.

120
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:59.489
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So it is still mandatory to provide the Sbom type, but it's recommended to put it as Sbom type Colon and the keyword

121
00:24:00.595 --> 00:24:11.219
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and also the last comment about it was the possibility to put

122
00:24:12.105 --> 00:24:17.039
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): several asper types for for the same.

123
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.250
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it was the same as Paul.

124
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:36.448
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So that's mostly clarification, and providing some some examples on on this. 2 other modifications.

125
00:24:38.872 --> 00:24:43.838
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): that are minor. But to be complete. They are also listed in

126
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:56.799
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in. In the history section of the document we well, there are several tools to merge as bombs.

127
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:08.260
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): One was mentioned in version one dot 0. But since then there is a new one that

128
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:13.830
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): is available which is called Sbom asm

129
00:25:14.688 --> 00:25:20.439
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it's provided by the Interlink Company, and it's

130
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:37.710
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it's open source. So from the tests I made, it gives much better results than the other tools that I had tested.

131
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:45.829
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So I replaced the reference on. As for marching with this tool

132
00:25:46.608 --> 00:25:50.589
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and last thing we we have added

133
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.490
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in the reference list, the new Caesar document.

134
00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.930
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

135
00:25:59.427 --> 00:26:17.440
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): what was also important for us? Was the issue of compatibility. So what is the case is that if

136
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:33.624
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): your S bomb is con is compliant to the version, one dot 0 of the guide. It will automatically be compliant with version one dot, one as I explained, we have

137
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:52.680
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): mostly relaxed some constraints to some fields that had that were mandatory in version one dot 0 are now only recommended.

138
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.935
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

139
00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:13.070
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): if you, if you are compatible with version one dot 0, you are automatically compliant. Version one dot one. And if you are not you, it will be easier to be compliant with with one dot one.

140
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:22.949
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And so last slide, what are the next steps?

141
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:36.856
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So we will in a few days provide an updated version of the python validator

142
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:58.986
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to be able to validate against version one dot, one instead of one dot 0. And there will be also an important modification, an important improvement of the validator. Unrelated to to the change of the

143
00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:09.689
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in the guide. In the next release we will allow recursive validation of S post

144
00:28:10.568 --> 00:28:32.530
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in these slides I mentioned Yocto. If you get an S from Yocto you will get many, perhaps more than 100 different Spdx files.

145
00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.571
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and the Spx files are

146
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:54.309
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): related from the Spdx relationship elements. So if you check this yocto output, you will have

147
00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:14.866
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a main file called something image and the name. And so with the next release of the validator, you will be able to do open chain

148
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:30.800
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): telco validator minus minus recursive, the name of the main file, and all files will be found and checked recursively, recursively.

149
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:44.850
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So that's for the work and the validator and as we have worked with the scan oss

150
00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:58.285
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): team, we will continue to to test the the output of several tools that produce spdx and

151
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:10.379
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): check their compliance with the guide, and, if needed, help make the the output compliant.

152
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:19.399
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So it's it's almost obvious that it will be

153
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:28.009
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): easier to do so with the the open source tool, where we can, if needed.

154
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:36.020
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): provide some guidance and even some patches than the than the commercial tools.

155
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:45.890
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Okay, so that was the end of my presentation.

156
00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.439
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Okay, I checked 0.

157
00:30:51.630 --> 00:31:08.171
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Some comments. Yes. So question from Yari Scanner has just mentioned. But how about other sca providers?

158
00:31:10.077 --> 00:31:26.609
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): As I. As I just said, we have tested the output of also tools. Some tools are quite close, but

159
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.220
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): not not fully

160
00:31:31.165 --> 00:31:44.850
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): compliant. One tool that we use quite extensively is a scan code. So there are minor

161
00:31:45.410 --> 00:32:10.639
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): non compliances with scan code, for instance, they don't put they they. There is no way to put the name of the company that creates the the S bomb, which is one of the requirements, and also they don't provide the

162
00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:18.698
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): anti s bomb type. So that's quite minor. We have filed

163
00:32:20.638 --> 00:32:28.890
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we have filed tickets for this, but it's not yet. Implemented.

164
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:37.269
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): there are. Antony made some

165
00:32:38.190 --> 00:33:06.530
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): comments. There are lots of merge tools out there. That's what I said. So I've tested several tools and the 1st tools I tested did not well, at least at the time where I tested did not provide even a valid spdx. As a result.

166
00:33:07.481 --> 00:33:24.109
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so for when, when S bomb Asm was provided, I was happy to test a new tool, you can check the

167
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.534
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the issue, the closed issues in the Github

168
00:33:31.502 --> 00:33:47.617
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): website. I've I think I I filed something like a dozen of of issues, mostly with Spdx validity issues.

169
00:33:49.151 --> 00:33:53.360
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): But they I was really impressed.

170
00:33:53.650 --> 00:34:09.506
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): They were quite reactive when I filed bugs. Some bugs were fixed in the next days or next day or 2, so at the end they fixed all all the bugs I had reported, and

171
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.177
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the the result is is now valid. Spdx.

172
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:18.659
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Oh.

173
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:35.149
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): okay, yes, there are. And in Spdx 2, there are no specific fields to describe the S bomb type, because Vs bomb type was created after Spdx 2.

174
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:45.230
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, that's what Anthony says. Very few Spx S bombs include S bomb types. It's

175
00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:55.145
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): okay. So external rep is not mandatory.

176
00:34:57.247 --> 00:35:23.259
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): well, it it was not. Well, it's it was not mandatory in one dot 0 also. The problem is that unless Pdx. As might contain proprietary code

177
00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:41.282
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): for which no Perl, no Perl is is possible. But yes, it's recommended. So it's encouraged to to put it for all open source components.

178
00:35:42.250 --> 00:36:07.213
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): There are validators on Spdx website. That's true. So the validator, we provide the open chain tech correspond validator we provided is based. It's written, it's written in python. So it's based

179
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:26.700
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): on the python tools that you that are developed by the Spdx team. So what we do is that we 1st check that with the python tools

180
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:42.464
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): that the Spdx is valid, and then we check the constraint, the additional constraints that are described in the Telco Guide.

181
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:58.949
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So, for instance, the presence of the of the S bomb type and all other requirements we have in the documents.

182
00:37:02.783 --> 00:37:22.316
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, anthony says that Yocto is moving to Spx free, as that's true. If I remember correctly in one. I don't remember if it was in an

183
00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:38.088
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): there was a presentation of this I don't remember if it was in an open china presentation, or it was in an Spdx presentation. But

184
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:53.616
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): yes, they are. They are working on producing Spdx free. But for the moment, at Nokia we we still use the Spdx. 2 generator.

185
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:03.104
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And does someone know? Shocked who is working under Spdx? And like the valid Spdx.

186
00:38:05.037 --> 00:38:31.362
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we we filed at Nokia. We filed some some issues about it. As was just mentioned, they are moving to outputting Spx free instead of Spx. 2. So I don't really know

187
00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:41.725
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): if you will fix via 2 issues. Okay?

188
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:45.200
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Oh.

189
00:38:47.013 --> 00:39:03.079
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the Ntia guide didn't specify check zones and did not mandate, but recommended to provide a hash for packages.

190
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:17.799
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Okay, so thank you for all these questions back to you.

191
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:26.029
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, thank you. And one more question coming from in the chat box from

192
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so, Missan, could you ask

193
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.940
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): Yeah, oh, yeah.

194
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:51.098
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): So yeah, I I just want wonder. So I think the create a comment or any other comment field, it can be put any type of the comments. So the yeah, if the

195
00:39:51.890 --> 00:40:15.118
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): if time can be a description of this will type can be encapsulated. So there's such as I wrote in the chat box. So so if if the such type of the syntax there's

196
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:32.250
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): we we can provide that so that the subtype can be written in the any comment field in the response, potentially, what do you think of the

197
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:33.340
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): such

198
00:40:34.075 --> 00:40:37.524
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, let let me share. Okay.

199
00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:55.330
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): yes. So in version, in in the 1st version, in version one dot 0 of the guide.

200
00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.259
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we, we said, you just have to put one of the words

201
00:41:02.136 --> 00:41:22.140
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): just the the keyword. So you could put, for instance, just create or comment analyzed or you could put the word in a sentence created during build phase. So

202
00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:40.370
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it is in one dot one. It is still possible to to just do that. But what we have changed in one dot one is that? Yes, we recommend

203
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:49.920
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to put something like this to put Sbom type Colon and the keyword

204
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:50.700
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): Oh, yeah.

205
00:41:50.700 --> 00:42:05.557
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So. So that's the recommended way. But we didn't want to make it mandatory, because that would mean that

206
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:13.250
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): you would no longer have full compatibility.

207
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:14.750
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): And

208
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:37.259
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Because that if we enforce, if we make this syntax mandatory, that would mean that would be compliant with one dot 0 would not be compatible with one dot one. So yes, we still

209
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:49.990
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): allow a flexible syntax, and we recommend a more, a better, a better syntax, which is what you have put in in the chat

210
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:51.900
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): Thank you.

211
00:42:52.090 --> 00:43:13.568
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): Yeah. So the if the the Creator comment only this one type description. So the such recommended syntax is, works. Well. But yeah, yeah, if the Creator want to put to the other

212
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.750
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): So the comments.

213
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:23.410
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): So the how how to describe the yeah.

214
00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:34.955
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, you can. You? You can put in the Creator comment. You can put Vs bomb type. But you also. It's a free text of

215
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:53.779
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a format. So you you can put Vs bomb type, and you can use it on on several on several lines and put additional information you want to to provide for for

216
00:43:54.090 --> 00:44:01.970
HOSOMI ITARU(細見　格): Yeah, it's it's just a yeah machine readability issue. So thank you for the comment

217
00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.799
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, thank you.

218
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:13.419
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And Anthony has also questions in the chat box.

219
00:44:15.086 --> 00:44:18.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, create document is often used for other information.

220
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:26.725
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yeah, yeah, that was perhaps not clear in version one dot 0. That is one of the points that were discussed

221
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:38.506
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): on on the mailing list. But, as I just said, it's a it's a a free text field that can contain

222
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.490
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): that can be put on multiple lines, and that

223
00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:49.329
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): can contain as as much information as possible. So you you can put

224
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:59.070
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the the S bomb type and also all other information you want to provide on on the package on the on the S bomb

225
00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.129
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much. And can I ask one question?

226
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:06.800
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Sure.

227
00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:18.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And it's a Shimira question regarding with Yari-san's questions. This guide not only covers the Ndi minimum.

228
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:22.540
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): but also includes several additional provisions

229
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:26.589
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): like such as create a command, and so on.

230
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:36.040
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And at present it seems that there aren't so many tools available that can meet these Acustora requirements.

231
00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:41.549
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So what is your plan for implementing this guide in the future.

232
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:48.689
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And now I learned, convinced many tool vendors. But

233
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:53.060
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): are there any other prompts to implementing this guide

234
00:46:00.029 --> 00:46:01.349
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes. Okay.

235
00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:16.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sorry. The the background of this question is within the Japanese community there has also been similar discussion, like additional information might be required for each industry.

236
00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:32.009
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But some concerns exist that the tools used by software suppliers may have difficulty fulfilling these requirements, because the in each industry has

237
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:35.310
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): other different requirements.

238
00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:43.999
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So how how can we proceed to implementing like these additional requirements?

239
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.489
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So what do you think? Or do you have any idea

240
00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:56.622
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, that's something we can. We can discuss.

241
00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:02.974
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So here at Nokia

242
00:47:05.022 --> 00:47:28.860
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we intend to provide to our customers S. Bombs that are compliant with the guide. So, as I said, our internal tools are producing that are compliant.

243
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:38.030
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): or we'll in in sometimes do it. We we still have to to modify some of our

244
00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:48.530
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): tools that generate Spdx and so we we can say to our customers that

245
00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:52.690
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we are following the open China Telco guide.

246
00:47:54.175 --> 00:47:55.250
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): That's

247
00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:13.296
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): perhaps the easiest part, because we we master it. But we also intend to require from our suppliers to to provide

248
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:28.842
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): as bonds with the software we use compliant with with the guide. So we we plan to

249
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:37.400
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to have this requirement in in our contract. So that's

250
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:48.709
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): well. Perhaps it will be difficult to to convince some some providers, but that's the long term goal.

251
00:48:49.916 --> 00:48:53.673
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And yes, as as I said, we

252
00:48:54.600 --> 00:49:07.612
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we we discuss with some 2 providers to to see if they can provide the compatible

253
00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.233
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): as Bob's

254
00:49:16.995 --> 00:49:33.694
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): What has been much discussed in these groups is that there are now several sets of requirements for S bombs. You have the

255
00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:49.590
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): minimum elements in Germany. The BSI have created something in India. They have also created

256
00:49:51.646 --> 00:50:07.490
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): recommendations. There will be also requirements coming from the European, and so on. So once

257
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:17.159
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): things are moving. And yes, precisely in this group we we are here to to discuss, to discuss that

258
00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:35.930
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so question about file analyzed in version one dot, one of the guide. It's it's no longer. It's no longer mentioned.

259
00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:49.890
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): You can use the the default value of true without putting files analyzed

260
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:59.560
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And Anthony also mentioned in the chat box. Anthony, could you speak out

261
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.419
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Hello there, yeah. And

262
00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.059
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I love.

263
00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:08.010
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I think I think I've mentioned this before. I think.

264
00:51:08.546 --> 00:51:11.700
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): The s. 1 type in the comment is being sort of.

265
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:27.390
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I see why you're doing it. And I think it's a bit of a it's working with the standard. But I think most people have used file names. I've certainly seen file names being used. I was involved in a

266
00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:40.439
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): a study of different S bombs with sei and tail end of last year, and the way we highlighted, which type of S bomb was just been the final name. So we had underscore source or underscore build.

267
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:43.570
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): and that was really easy to filter.

268
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:52.510
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): particularly as not everybody understands what the contents need to be.

269
00:51:53.039 --> 00:52:03.860
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So that's my only that's my only comment. I think everything else you're doing is similar to what other people are doing. There's no consistency, which is a big challenge. I think we all recognize

270
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:21.149
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): and cyclone Dx. 1.6 does have lifecycle, which is very similar to what's been proposed. And Spdx 3 has the type. It's just that we're sort of a little bit behind with Spdx 2.3. Maybe, you know, things will work themselves out.

271
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:24.957
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So actually, it's just a comment.

272
00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:35.299
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): and yeah, I have a library that generates S bombs. It's very easy for me to add the S bomb type into the comment field.

273
00:52:35.916 --> 00:52:39.319
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So you know, it's that's it'll just

274
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:48.800
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): fall out provided you specify the type when you are building the you know, using a library to build it, build the s 1

275
00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:53.519
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much.

276
00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:00.179
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, Maxine, thank you very much.

277
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:04.840
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Anna. Are there any questions or comments

278
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:25.109
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Just one brief comment. Naturally, I'm going to be reaching out to market on and the Telco Work group to publicize this fantastic release. And I'm also going to talk with Scanoss

279
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:32.900
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): about how we can communicate their work. It's it sounds like what's happened with Telco

280
00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:40.200
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is, you know, we had the initial guide, the proof of it, the people adopting it. And now this refinement.

281
00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:54.970
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So it's it's like we've already gone quite a distance in the journey of looking at Sbom quality. So I just wanted to say, it's fantastic work. And this presentation, this overview, was very useful

282
00:53:57.714 --> 00:54:10.050
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, so we scan. Oss team will make a blog post about being comfortable with the Telco guide, but it's not out yet.

283
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:21.239
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): If you could introduce me to who's doing it, I'll synchronize with them, and maybe we can do the marketing on the same day.

284
00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:24.469
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Okay, I will. I will give you the contact.

285
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:26.599
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That's super great. Thank you.

286
00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:32.310
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, thank you.

287
00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:47.810
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay. We have 10 min left. And, Maxon, thank you very much for your presentation. Much appreciated.

288
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:49.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much.

289
00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.329
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): I will send you the the slides.

290
00:54:52.800 --> 00:55:03.380
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you. Okay. And we have only 10 min left. And as a last, I have one open question

291
00:55:05.032 --> 00:55:23.639
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): today's great presentation based on great presentation to ensure this level of quality. Is it helpful? I'd like to ask all of you, is it helpful to create new specification or guide guideline in other industry

292
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:27.810
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): or industry, neutral guide right?

293
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:33.659
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Or can we rely on the existing guidelines or regulations?

294
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:43.569
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): That is enough. We shouldn't create or check, create or build any regulations or specification.

295
00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'd like to ask all of your opinions.

296
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:52.599
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): are there anyone to open your thoughts?

297
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:07.050
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, yes. Industry, neutral specification. Yes, I need it.

298
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:10.089
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, I think so. Awesome

299
00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:10.590
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): We?

300
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:16.560
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): We're at the early stages of S-boms.

301
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:34.969
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Some industries are more advanced than others, you know. Medical devices probably have got a level of maturity. But you know, if we look at what's going to happen in Europe with the coa, I think that will be very interesting to see where we get to. I think we need a very low

302
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:40.969
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): bar initially before we start adding extra things. You know.

303
00:56:41.110 --> 00:57:00.210
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Let's just get an inventory of components. We haven't got that yet, and you know. So let's try and get a consistent, you know. Let's good get good metadata about what a component is before we start adding extra features like, you know, links to repose link to even checksums.

304
00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:12.439
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Personally. I think I you know, working. I'm working with some with a company. And basically, we just want an inventory. That's a big step forward for many companies, you know, consistent inventory of the whole supply chain.

305
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:18.050
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So let's start slowly and and move consistently

306
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:20.960
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much.

307
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:23.370
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I suppose? Yeah.

308
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:27.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you. Thank you. So thank you. Shan. Please go ahead

309
00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:35.010
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Oh, right. Thank you, Kabota Sam. I suppose one interesting question is whether we can take

310
00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:40.260
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the energy we saw with Telco creating a guide

311
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:47.179
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and go to the the high level of what is being accomplished. And let's say we choose

312
00:57:48.030 --> 00:58:07.259
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the minimum possible to do. License. Compliance is a a valid business. Use case meeting, ntia requirements, valid business. Use case very soon, meeting the cra requirements, and so on and so forth. So if if we were

313
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:18.000
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to continue exploring S bomb quality and thinking of it from a multi industry. I think that

314
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:30.180
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to Anthony's point, we we could focus on the minimal needed to accomplish various business objectives, and maybe the useful type of guide

315
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:39.810
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): would be to understand how Telco did it, which we have done, and and then look at a guide which would

316
00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:43.999
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): give examples of accomplishing certain business goals.

317
00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.549
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): This is what you need to ask from your suppliers for ntia.

318
00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:55.629
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): This is what you need to ask for if you're doing minimal license compliance and so on and so forth.

319
00:58:56.290 --> 00:59:18.479
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And this isn't about an Sbom format. It's about what would be needed to be asked. Now with the Ntia, we're lucky that they just give a list. Have this, and you know, with the cra, I think we can probably expect the same with license compliance. We we do know as an industry, what's the minimal viable needed.

320
00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:26.019
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So perhaps if we went down this route, a guide to accomplishing business objectives.

321
00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:34.529
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And then people could select multiple objectives like, I need ntia. I need license. I need Cra.

322
00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.840
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): What do I ask my suppliers for this list.

323
00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:48.989
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and then, you know, they could choose their Sbom format. They might ask for that in Spdx, or they might ask for that in cyclone. Not really.

324
00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:52.884
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): not really our challenge to

325
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:58.380
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): determine format, though we could give examples in different formats.

326
00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:05.270
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So yeah, that's that's 1, i think might be useful.

327
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:12.449
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): because we can't really predict what every industry will want. But we can predict what regulations

328
01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:20.359
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): every industry may be subject to, and therefore we could quickly describe those in a guide. Does that make sense

329
01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:31.380
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, and sonia has an opinion, I think

330
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.910
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I have lots of opinions, sorry and

331
01:00:36.296 --> 01:00:36.683
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sorry.

332
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:52.259
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Do we want an S bomb for each use case so like an S bomb for license compliance probably doesn't need much information, as I think, from a lot. Use an S bomb for vulnerability management?

333
01:00:52.390 --> 01:01:03.340
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Or do you create an S bomb that covers both use cases just as an example. Now, my personal view is, I would like to have one

334
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:15.719
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): 1 point of truth that can be used many for many, many use cases rather than having different ones, because keeping track of multiple ones gets hard. So my view is you, you have the superset.

335
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:31.829
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): However, I'm just halfway writing a comment. Most companies just ask for an S bomb. They don't ask for an S bomb for a particular use case. So at the moment we've still got education in terms of the consumers.

336
01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:37.679
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): and to to make sure they ask for the S bomb with the right attributes

337
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.579
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Oh, yes, no, absolutely I I don't disagree. I I think that it's a case of if

338
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:57.540
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): if we look at what Telco's done is they've essentially asked for. I don't know what is 14 or 16 things, and said, that's what we need for ntia and license compliance.

339
01:01:57.790 --> 01:02:11.350
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And if we went cross industry. We might have variations in industries, or we might have, you know, one company saying, I want license, compliance, and security, but I don't care about Ntia. I don't sell into America.

340
01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.960
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So

341
01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:29.370
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I completely agree. Strategically speaking, there should be one S-bomb, and the challenge for us, I think, is probably that different industries will have a different idea, or even different companies would have a different idea of what's their one favorite S bomb.

342
01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:47.949
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So if we do create a guide, it would probably have to be modular, so people could select the modules they need. For instance, when Japan has its S-bomb regulation very important for Japanese companies not at all important for a Chinese company selling to China alone.

343
01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:55.420
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So you know, I I guess what we could do is explain the thing you need to ask for to accomplish goal

344
01:02:55.660 --> 01:03:01.180
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): A and accomplish both goal B. And perhaps also say

345
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:08.810
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): you should ask for all of these things at once. If they're relevant, you know, stack the things that are relevant for you.

346
01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:15.680
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and if if we got that right, it should be possible for companies to very quickly

347
01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:23.919
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): see what is the list of things I need. So I can accomplish business goal. ABC. In my industry.

348
01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:40.919
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): different companies might still ask for different S. Bombs. But it's probably natural that Sony might ask for a different S-bomb to meet different requirements and regulations compared to Qnap in in Taiwan, just because they have a different stuff going on

349
01:03:47.050 --> 01:04:09.546
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you for the discussion, but I'm sorry I don't have more time for this meeting. I concrete, and I needed to leave for next meeting. So I will summarize today's discussion and push it on the Github for the meeting memos. And

350
01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:17.779
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I will send an email to for this discussion. So please continue the discussion on the mail list.

351
01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:30.879
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and so thank you for today's journey attendance, and I will look forward to seeing you next time.

352
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:32.630
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much.

353
01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:33.439
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): You.

354
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:35.339
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Thank you, thank you. Take care

355
01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, thank you very much. See? You

356
01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:41.389
Vivek Kumar Sahu (Individual Contribution): Thank you. Everyone, bye, have a nice day

357
01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.430
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Bye, bye, you too.
