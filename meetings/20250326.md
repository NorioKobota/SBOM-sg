### Overall Summary
This meeting was the 7th session of the OpenChain SBOM Study Group. The primary focus was an **overview of the recently released version 1.1 of the OpenChain Telco Guide** presented by Marc-Etienne Vargenau from Nokia. The update includes **minor modifications primarily aimed at improving compatibility with tools like Yocto** and clarifying requirements such as handling of package hashes and SBOM types. A key aspect of the presentation was demonstrating how the guide is being put into practice at Nokia and the plan to require compliance from suppliers. The presentation also covered updates to the associated validator tool and efforts to work with tool providers like SCANOSS to improve compliance. Following the presentation, there was a discussion on the **challenges of tool support for requirements beyond minimum standards** and a broader conversation about the **future direction of SBOM guides** – specifically, whether new industry-specific or industry-neutral guides are needed, focusing on achieving various business objectives.

### Discussion

*   **Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation)**
    *   Mentioned attending the LF Member Summit and the **growing attention on SBOM work in regulated industries like finance**.
    *   Announced upcoming Open Source Summit locations in Europe, Korea, Japan, and North America (Denver) and recommended attending.
    *   Praised the OpenChain Telco Work group and Marc for the **Telco Guide release and overview**, noting the progress in SBOM quality discussions.
    *   Expressed plans to publicize the guide update and synchronize marketing efforts with SCANOSS regarding their tool's compliance.
    *   Proposed focusing on the **minimal SBOM requirements needed to achieve specific business objectives** (like NTIA, license compliance, CRA) from a multi-industry perspective.
    *   Suggested a **modular guide** that outlines what attributes suppliers should be asked for to meet selected business goals, rather than focusing solely on format.
    *   Agreed that strategically there should be one SBOM, but acknowledged different industries/companies may have different needs, making a modular approach helpful.

*   **Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project)**
    *   Asked about the **compliance status of other SCA (Software Composition Analysis) providers** besides SCANOSS with the Telco guide.
    *   Inquired if **Yocto is working on making their SPDX output valid**.
    *   Commented that **SBOMs should ideally work for both license compliance and vulnerability management**.
    *   Raised the question of component levels (package, file, snippet) in SBOMs.

*   **Vivek Kumar Sahu (Individual Contribution)**
    *   Listed common use cases for SBOMs: **compliance frameworks (NTIA), license compliance, components list, and vulnerabilities**.

*   **Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation)**
    *   Shared a recap of the previous meeting's discussion on **challenges within Japanese communities** regarding SBOMs.
    *   Asked Marc about the **plan for implementing the guide** given that many tools don't yet support the additional requirements beyond the NTIA minimums. Noted the concern in the Japanese community that supplier tools may struggle with different industry-specific requirements.
    *   Posed the open question to the group: is it helpful to **create new industry-specific or industry-neutral SBOM specifications/guidelines**, or are existing ones sufficient?.

*   **Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation)**
    *   Presented an **overview of the OpenChain Telco Guide version 1.1**.
    *   Explained that **Nokia is putting the guide into practice** and plans to require suppliers to provide compliant SBOMs.
    *   Detailed modifications in v1.1: **allowing both `package checksum` and `package verification code`** for the hash requirement (aligning with CISA guidance), **no longer requiring `files analyzed`** (allowing the default `true`), downgrading package hash and external ref (for PURL) from mandatory to recommended.
    *   Addressed how **SBOM type is handled in SPDX2 using `CreatorComment`**. Version 1.1 recommends the syntax `SBOM type: keyword` for clarity, while still allowing the old flexible syntax for compatibility.
    *   Discussed challenges with tool compliance, noting that while **SCANOSS output is now compliant**, other tools like Scan code have minor non-compliances.
    *   Highlighted the **validator update** which will support v1.1 and include **recursive validation** for SBOMs composed of multiple files (like Yocto output).
    *   Acknowledged that Yocto is moving towards SPDX3.
    *   Responded that the OpenChain validator uses SPDX Python tools and adds Telco guide specific constraints.

*   **HOSOMI ITARU(細見 格)**
    *   Asked for clarification on the **recommended syntax for SBOM type within the `CreatorComment` field** for machine readability.
    *   Followed up by asking how other comments could be included if `CreatorComment` is used for SBOM type.
    *   Asked if `FilesAnalyzed` is still recommended in v1.1 or no longer mentioned.
    *   Asked if a new quality spec/guide should explicitly **choose and specify concrete objectives (license, security, etc.)** for the SBOM.

*   **Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable)**
    *   Mentioned he is working on a **validator/converter**, including for CycloneDX to OpenChain compliant SBOMs.
    *   Noted that the original **NTIA guide recommended but did not mandate checksums**.
    *   Expressed **disappointment that `ExternalRef` (for PURL) is not mandatory** in the guide, encouraging PURL for all open source components.
    *   Commented that **few SPDX SBOMs currently include SBOM type** as it was defined after SPDX 2.3.
    *   Agreed that `CreatorComment` is often used for other information.
    *   Observed that most of the Telco guide aligns with other initiatives, but the use of `CreatorComment` for SBOM type is notable, as other approaches use attributes (CycloneDX 1.6 `lifecycle`) or filename conventions. Highlighted the **lack of consistency across different initiatives as a big challenge**.
    *   Favored having a **single, enriched SBOM (a superset)** that covers multiple use cases (license, vulnerability management), rather than different SBOMs for each use case, as managing multiple is difficult.
    *   Stated that **most companies lack understanding of SBOM use cases** and don't specify required attributes when asking for an SBOM, indicating a need for consumer education.
    *   Argued for focusing on **content based on use case, not just the format**.
    *   Believes that given the early stages of SBOM adoption, the focus should be on establishing a **low bar for entry**, such as a consistent inventory of components, before adding more complex requirements.
    *   Strongly advocated for **industry-neutral specifications** over industry-specific ones, as components are often used across multiple industries.

**Discussion Outcomes and Future TODOs**

*   **OpenChain Telco Guide v1.1 Release:** The updated guide has been released, incorporating changes to align better with tool outputs like Yocto and clarifying requirements.
*   **Tool Compliance:** Work is ongoing to test and help SBOM generation tools, particularly open source ones, become compliant with the guide. SCANOSS output is now compliant.
*   **Validator Update:** An updated Python validator supporting v1.1 and featuring recursive validation is planned for release soon.
*   **Industry Adoption:** Nokia is using the guide internally and intends to require compliance from suppliers.
*   **Future Guide Direction (Unresolved):** The discussion about whether to create new industry-specific or industry-neutral guides, or guides focused on business objectives and use cases, was initiated. There was sentiment for industry-neutral guidance and focusing on the minimum required for specific use cases or a superset covering multiple use cases. No consensus or decision was reached in the meeting.
*   **TODO:** The discussion on the future direction of SBOM guides will **continue on the mailing list**. Norio Kobota will summarize the meeting discussion and share it on GitHub.
*   **TODO:** Shane Coughlan plans to **publicize the v1.1 release** and coordinate with SCANOSS marketing efforts.
*   **TODO:** Continue testing and helping tool providers achieve compliance.
