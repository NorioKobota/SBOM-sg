### Overall Summary

This meeting focused on improving the quality and standardization of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs). Participants from various companies and open source communities discussed the challenges related to inconsistent information granularity, the lack of unified standards, and the need for automation in handling SBOM data. The discussion also addressed potential workshops and collaborative events to explore these issues in greater depth.

### Discussion

#### 1. Inconsistency in Component Granularity

##### Discussion Points
- Issue: Different suppliers provide SBOMs with varying levels of detail (file level, package level, or snippet/function level), which creates difficulties when integrating the data into internal systems.
- Use Case Differentiation: The required granularity may differ based on the intended use of the SBOM (for example, license compliance versus vulnerability management). There is a need to clarify exactly what should be requested from suppliers.

##### Opinions and Reactions
- Anthony Harrison explained that converting from one granularity (such as file level) to another (such as package level) is challenging and stressed the need for clear, use-case–specific requirements. His comment received several positive reactions.
- Jari Koivisto noted that the SBOM document differs from the internal database representation, indicating that databases may need to store extended metadata.
- Rakesh Prabhakaran shared his organization’s experience by stating that suppliers differ in maturity, and suggested defining mandatory versus optional fields. He mentioned that his team will provide a repository link for further review.

##### Conclusions and Action Items
- Define Granularity Requirements: Clearly define the required level of detail for different use cases (for example, vulnerability management versus license compliance).
- Establish Checkpoints: Develop specific checkpoints outlining what information must be provided by each supplier.
- Github Issue: Initiate a discussion on GitHub to gather feedback from all parties and collaboratively draft global guidelines.

#### 2. Diversity of Information and Lack of Standardization

##### Discussion Points
- Issue: The information provided by different SBOM generation tools varies widely. Details such as build options or environmental data may be missing, affecting the accuracy of dependency tracking and reproducibility.
- Need for Standardization: With multiple formats available (for example, SPDX and CycloneDX), it is necessary to determine which data fields are essential and to agree on consistent definitions across the industry.

##### Opinions and Reactions
- Anthony Harrison warned that many existing SBOM tools fail to meet even the minimum required fields and expressed concern that demanding too much information might reduce practicality.
- Rakesh Prabhakaran mentioned that his company has developed a schema for SPDX 2.3 and CycloneDX 1.4 that distinguishes between mandatory and optional fields. This information was met with positive reactions from other participants.
- There was general consensus on the need for a unified, generic schema that can be applied across various industries, along with the establishment of clear mapping rules between different tools.

##### Conclusions and Action Items
- Draft Unified Guidelines: Develop a draft for unified guidelines specifying the mandatory and optional SBOM data fields, using open source schema examples as a basis.
- Community Discussions: Continue discussions on GitHub to refine the proposed guidelines.
- Regulatory Considerations: Ensure the design is flexible to accommodate future regulatory changes such as evolving EU standards.

#### 3. Automation and Tool Utilization

##### Discussion Points
- Issue: There is a demand for automation tools that normalize and verify SBOM data across different formats. However, while format conversion might be achievable, unifying the actual content remains a major challenge.
- Hybrid Approach: The discussion examined whether full automation is feasible or if manual verification will remain necessary in complex cases.

##### Opinions and Reactions
- Anthony Harrison commented that while format conversion is technically feasible, unifying the content is a larger challenge.
- Rakesh Prabhakaran suggested that before developing any automation tools (such as parsers or transform scripts), it is important to communicate clear requirements to suppliers.
- Marc-Etienne Vargenau from Nokia agreed that automation is essential but underscored the need for well-defined, use-case–driven specifications.

##### Conclusions and Action Items
- Establish Common Specifications: Finalize industry-wide specifications (including required fields and details on granularity) before developing automation tools.
- Prototype Automation Tools: Form a working group to create a prototype (e.g., a parser or transform script) and assess its effectiveness.
- Hybrid Verification: Evaluate a hybrid approach that combines automated processing with manual checks where necessary.

#### 4. Future Workshops and Collaborative Events

##### Discussion Points
- Event Formats: Participants discussed organizing workshops and webinars to explore these issues further and share case studies. The idea of hybrid events (including both face-to-face and remote participation) was considered.
- International Participation: There was special emphasis on including regions such as Japan by exploring more virtual participation options.

##### Opinions and Reactions
- Marcel Kurzmann from Bosch introduced the idea of organizing "OpenChain & Friends" workshops, which might include pre- and post-event webinars to demonstrate tools and conduct discussions.
- Norio Kobota from Sony stressed the importance of ongoing dialogue using GitHub issues and local community discussions to share challenges and solutions.
- Oliver Fendt from Siemens highlighted the need to incorporate input from commercial tool vendors and expressed a desire to see a concrete action item list from the meeting.

##### Conclusions and Action Items
- Hybrid Event Planning: Review and decide on event formats that combine in-person and virtual participation to maximize international involvement.
- Agenda and Group Breakouts: Organize breakout sessions by topic (such as tool development, specification standardization, and case studies) for future events.
- Follow-up Reporting: Assign responsible parties to consolidate feedback from workshops and present it in the next meeting.

#### Participants' Overall Reactions

- Many participants showed support for clear requirements and the need for standardized guidelines, as indicated by numerous positive reactions.
- Anthony Harrison consistently emphasized the difficulties in converting between different SBOM granularities and stressed that unifying the content is the key issue.
- Rakesh Prabhakaran shared his organization’s experience and noted that open source schemas have been developed, with a commitment to provide further resources.
- The need for international collaboration in the form of both in-person and virtual events was a recurring theme.

#### Results and TODOs:

- Key Focus: The meeting underlined the importance of defining specific requirements (such as granularity and mandatory versus optional fields) based on the various use cases for SBOMs.
- Immediate Actions:
  - Create and circulate a draft guideline on SBOM granularity and standard fields on GitHub.
  - Form a working group to prototype automation tools for SBOM normalization while considering a hybrid verification process.
  - Plan future events (both workshops and webinars) that ensure broader participation and include feedback from both commercial vendors and open source communities.
- Next Deadline: Participants are encouraged to open issues, submit feedback, and prepare for further collaborative sessions on the designated GitHub repository before the next meeting.
